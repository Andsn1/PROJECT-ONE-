# Events Round The Corner

## Description

Someone from The US has moved to the UK and wishes to explore all the major cities in their spare time. In order to make the search a simple task for the foreigner we have devised an app that can provide events in the local area that they're in. These events and/or food places will guarantee they have a verified and vouched experience wherever they are in the UK.
